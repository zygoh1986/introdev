1. React Hooks
    How many types of components are there in reactJS (2)
        Class
            Page -> parameters / arguments
            State -> JS object to capture properties
        Functions
            Can accept arguments but they do not have State
            I use hooks to use state in functional components as well

    Simple function useState is called when we have to interact with state for functional components
