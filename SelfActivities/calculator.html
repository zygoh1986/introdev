<!--Calculator - break the idea into smaller pieces
1. Design what you want to do or how you want 
    BRD - to document requirements
    FSD - to define the functional specifications
2. Write the HTML structure of the calculator
    Basic skeleton
    Any elements that may need to show up dynamically in 
        Numbers
        Operators
        Screen for input + result
3. Write the CSS to the HTML to make it look the way you want to
    Background color
    Layout of the buttons and screen

4. Apply the styles written in CSS to the calcuator HTML

5. Add JS functions for calculations
    Define a class for mathematical operations
    Create functions for each function
    Add error handling for each operation
    Add error handling for general scenarios

6. Start using JS functions to perform calculations based on specific button clicks
    Add events
    Add event listeners to call functions on each operation

7. Create a mehanism to store user input and perform calculations
    Store multiple operands (numbers) to send to js functions for operations

8. Display the result back on the calculator
9. Test the functionality

a. Use button
b. Use an input element with type button
c. use a div with onclick event
<div class="btn col-lg-4"><p> Button <p>
